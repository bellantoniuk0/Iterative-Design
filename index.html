        CSCI1300: User Interface and User Experience - Iterative Design and Evaluation
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of the project was to design an interactive interface for an emerging startup. We chose the plant-based seafood company, <a href="https://www.numifoods.co/" target="_blank"> Numi Foods.</a> 
      </p>

      <p>Pre-Design Thinking:</p>
      <p>Before we began prototyping we had to learn a little bit about Numi foods and their goals as a company. 
      <p>Numi is an emerging plant-based seafood company currently focusing on educating people on plant-based alternatives and 
        sustainability. </p>
      <p>Sketching:</p>
      <p>Next, we created some sketches after brainstorming ideas for Numi's new site. Attached are a large variety of ideas we came up with.</p>

            <p>After sketching, we created a first iteration hi-fidelity prototype. This prototype was tested and critiqued by other students in our class.</p>
            <p>Attached is some of the feedback we recieved from our peers:</p>

            <p>Taking critiques into account, we created a second and final hi-fidelity protype using Figma. </p>

            <p>Next we submitted our prototype for user testing. We provided 5 tasks for 3 users to complete.</p>
            <p>Attached our the tasks we submitted for user testing:</p>

            <p>The goal of user testing was to understand more about our design and discover potential errors that we were unaware of.</p>
